  <h1>Dropping out of Computer Science</h1>
  <p>
    To whom it may interest.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am dropping out of my Computer Science program at Oslo Metropolitan University.
    There are a myriad of factors and reasons and I could go on for while, but I'll try to keep as short as I can.
  </p>
<p>TLDR at the end.</p>

<p>
  In high school I studied Media & Communication. I entered the program with a love for photography and I ended up
  picking up graphic design along the way. I excelled and thrived working on creative projects. I went on to get
  straight A's and my teachers were shocked when they found out I would go on to study Business Administration at BI
  in Oslo. I loved photography and design but I didn't see myself making "a lot" of money doing that (which was my
  goal at the time) so I wanted something more cookie cutter and more stable (which is what I thought I wanted).
  I went on to graduate from BI, specializing in International Business. Something I am proud of, however I had a
  feeling that I did not want to work crunching numbers and looking at spreadsheets all day.

  I went on to work a part time job for two years not really doing anything in particular to figure out what I wanted
  to do, before randomly looking for programs to get back into school. I stumbled upon a few different programs but
  ended up applying for Computer Science. It was quite random to be perfectly honest. I was looking to get back into
  school to get some form of "routine" again, apart from going to work and going to the gym. I've always loved "tech"
  more specifically consumer electronics and the "science" behind it. So I thought I would at least give it a shot, and
  I did. But I realize now that I've been enrolled in the program for about 3 months that it is not what I expected, and
  it is not for me. I've realized over the course of 5 years that I am in fact more of a visual and creative person. I
  do not enjoy numbers and logic as much as I do visual and creative work. It took me 5 years, a BA degree and 3 months
  of a a Computer Science program to realize who I really am. I know for some people this come across as stupid, but you
  know what, in these past five years I've learned so much about myself and though I wish I could have figured it out
  sooner, I am glad to have experienced everything I did. All the people I have met, the life long friendships formed,
  the highs, the lows, the lessons and the small victories along the way makes it all worthwhile.

  To my fellow com sci students I would like to sincerely thank you for the time I have been privileged to spend with all
  of you. Whether we've gotten close or we've talked briefly in the hallway or during breaks. To all my group project members
  and to all our professors. Thank you. Thank you for being a part of my journey and thank you for letting me have the honor
  of being your class rep. You're a great bunch and I know many of you will go on and do amazing things. I'm sure you will.
  I hope to see you around. If you ever want to talk over a cup of coffee/tea about anything and everything I'm just a DM away.
  Maybe our paths will cross sometime when we're all working in the industry. Time will surely tell. Till then take care of
  yourselves.

    TLDR: I'm dropping out because com sci is not for me. I realize I'm more of a visual/creative person and I'm going back to
    my roots from high school, doing creative work. It took me five years to figure everything out but I'm glad I did.
