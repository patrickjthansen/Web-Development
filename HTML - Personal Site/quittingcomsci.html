  <h1>Dropping out of Computer Science</h1>
  <p>
    To whom it may interest.
  </p>

  <p>
    It may or may not come across as a shock, but I am dropping out of the Computer Science program at Oslo Metropolitan
    University. There are a myriad of factors and reasons behind why I am choosing to do so, and I could go on about it for while.
  </p>

  <p>
    TLDR at the end.
  </p>

  <p>
    In high school I studied Media & Communication. I entered the program with a love for photography and I ended up picking up graphic
    design along the way. I had fun, excelled, and thrived working on creative projects. I went on to get straight A's and my projects
    would be showcased before new students the following year. That is one of the things I miss the most, feeling a sense of mastery in
    something. Hence why my teachers were shocked to learn that I would go on to study Business Administration at BI in Oslo. It was out
    of left field looking when I look back at it now honestly haha. I loved photography and design but I did not see myself making "a lot"
    of money doing that (which was my motivation at the time) so I wanted something that could provide stability, more cookie cutter if
    you like (which is what I thought I wanted). I mean wearing a suit to work everyday making a lot of money would be cool right? haha.
    I went on to graduate from BI with a bachelor's degree in Business Administration specializing in International Business. Something I
    am immensely proud of, however, I had a feeling that I did not want to work 9 to 5 glued to a screen crunching numbers and staring at
    spreadsheets all day.
  </p>

  <p>
    I went on to work part time jobs for two years, with seemingly no direction and not really doing anything in particular to figure out
    what I wanted to do. I suppose you could say that I was in a limbo before randomly looking for programs to get back into school. I
    stumbled upon a few different programs but ended up applying for Computer Science. It was a bit of an arbitrary decision to be perfectly
    honest. I was looking to get back into school to get some form of "routine" again, other than going to work and going to the gym. I have
    always loved "tech" more specifically consumer electronics and the "science" behind it. So I thought "I owe it to myself to at least give
    it a go", and I did. But I realize now, having been enrolled in the program for about 3 months, that it is not what I expected, and it is
    not for me. I cannot say I am surprised, but you never know until you have tried it right? I finally mustered up the courage to do what I
    couldn't do when I was at BI, and that is to drop out. I've realized over the course of 5 years that I am in fact more of a visual and
    creative person. I do not enjoy numbers and logic as much as I do visual and creative work. It took me 5 years, a business degree and 3
    months of a a Computer Science program to realize who I really am. That there is no "shame" in dropping out. If anything it shows that you
    are self aware enough to know where to draw the line and get out. I know for some people this might come across as stupid, but you know what,
    in these past five years I've learned so much about myself, I have grown heaps and bounds and though I wish I could have figured it out sooner,
    I am glad to have experienced everything I did. It has all been a part of me finally coming to terms with who I really am. All the experiences,
    the people I have met, the life long friendships formed, the lessons, the highs, the lows, and everything in between, makes it all worthwhile.

    To my fellow Com Sci students I would like to sincerely thank you for the time I have been privileged to spend with all of you. Whether we've
    gotten close or we've talked briefly in the hallway or during breaks. To all my group project members and to all our professors. Thank you.
    Thank you for being a part of my journey and thank you for letting me have the honor of being your class rep.
  </p>

  <p>
    I would like to apologize for any shortcomings as a class representative, and if I did not get to respond to your messages in a timely manner
    I am truly sorry. I am more than open to any feedback you might have for me. You have all been very kind to me and for that I would like to
    thank you once more. Also I would like to apologize for the lack of social events/activities, the current pandemic did not exactly help the
    situation. However I hope you can still manage to meet up with each other and make connections outside of class. And for whatever it's worth
    I'll be in and around campus from time to time even after I post this. I have a locker to clear out and certain things to get in order before
    I leave for good lol. If you see me around campus, do not be afraid to reach out if there's anything I can do for you.
  </p>

  <p>
    You're a great bunch and I know many of you will go on to do amazing things. That, I am certainly sure of. I hope to see you around. If you
    ever want to talk over a cup of coffee/tea about anything and everything I'm just a DM away. I want to wish you all good luck moving forward.
    Maybe our paths will cross sometime when we're all working in the industry. Time will surely tell. Till then take care of yourselves.

    TLDR: I'm dropping out because com sci is not for me. I realize I'm more of a visual/creative person and I'm going back to my roots from
    high school, doing creative work. It took me five years to figure everything out but I'm glad I did. It was a pleasure working with you all,
    thank you for letting me be your class rep. I'm here if you need to talk over a cup of coffee/tea. Best of luck to you all and take care.
